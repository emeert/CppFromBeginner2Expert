/*
Exercise 2.

Write a program that asks the user how many values should get added together (from 2 to 5).
Then the user should input those numbers. Write a function "addition" that takes two double
parameters and adds them together, printing out in the console the calculation. Furthermore
overload the "addition" function 3 times so it takes three parameters, four parameters and
five parameters adding those parameters in each case. Prepare a switch that uses the version
of addition function with as many parameters as the user inputted at the beginning.

eg.

User inputted:
3

Output:
Input 1 Number.
Input 2 Number.
Input 3 Number.

User inputted:
2
3
4

Output:
2 + 3 + 4 = 9

PS Keep in mind that this exercise can be solved better than the given solution when you have more knowledge of C++. Better solution will be shown in future lessons.
