/*
    Exercise 1.

    Initialize three variables with different types (int, double, string). Write a function 
    "variableType" and overload it two times. Each three overloaded functions should take as
    an argument different type of variable eg. variableType(int), variableType(double),
    variableType(string). Send the variables created in the beginning to the variableType
    function with corresponding type of argument and print out in the screen information
    about what type of variable was used.

    eg.
    Output:
    2 - this variable was an integer
    0.123 - this variable was a double
    "What a beautiful day" - this variable was a string
