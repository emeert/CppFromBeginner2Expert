Exercise 3.

Working on the program from the exercises 1 and 2 modify the code in order to let the user
place 'X' and 'O' signs (like in tick-tack-toe game). The signs should be placed in turns
(alternately, once X, once O to simulate two players playing).


eg.

    1     2     3



    4     5     6



    7     8     9


Player 1 inputted:
x: 2
y: 3

Output:

    1     2     3



    4     5     6



    7     X     9

Player 2 inputted:
x: 1
y: 1

Output:

    O     2     3



    4     5     6



    7     X     9
